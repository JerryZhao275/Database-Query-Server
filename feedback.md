## Code
Great job on implementing majority of the functionality.

## Report
Nice overview of your implementation and discussion on design choices. It would have been nice to see some discussion on how each worker retrieved requests from the buffer independent of eachother. Since caching has not been implemented/discussed no marks could be given for it.
